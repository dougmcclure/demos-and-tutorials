Extending Netcool Operations Insight (NOI) Event Search --> http://dougmcclure.net/blog/2014/05/extending-netcool-operations-insight-event-search/

This blog post lays the foundation for this series on how to extend Netcool Operations Insight (NOI) in a number of ways.  The first post talks about setting up an integration using a Netcool Socket Gateway to send events through logstash and into SCALA.  These files are examples of the core configurations discussed in the blog post.

MyLogstash.conf
MyEventHeader.csv
MyEventDSVPack.props


The next blog post will talk about the Event Analysis App that can be used within SCALA as an example for an approach for continuous improvement within your event management process and infrastructure.

Event Analysis App/ --> contains a number of files to be introduced in the next blog post.
