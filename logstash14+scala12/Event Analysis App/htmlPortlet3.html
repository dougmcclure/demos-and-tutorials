		<h2>Event Analysis App Walk Through</h2>
<br/>
<strong>Step 1- Launch 1-EventHotSpots-EventTrendBySeverity</strong>A common starting point for event analysis includes analyzing the event volume trends over time. In this app, we're showing five very common dimensions for analyzing the event volumne trends by severity. 
<ul>
<li>The first chart shows Event Trends by Severity for the past hour aggregated at the minute level.</li>
<li>The second chart shows Event Trends by Severity for the past day aggregated at the hour level.</li>
<li>The third chart shows Event Trends by Severity for the past week aggregated at the day level.</li>
<li>The fourth chart shows Event Trends by Severity for the past month aggregated at the week level.</li>
<li>The fifth chart shows Event Trends by Severity for the past year aggregated at the month level.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Step 2- Launch 2-EventHotspots-Node</strong>This event analysis app includes analysing events originating by the source end point system, EMS/NMS, probe/integration gateway, etc. This could also be modified to look at the manager field to see the top event volumes by source system or integration. 
<ul>
<li>The first chart shows Top 20 Nodes with the highest event counts over the past day.</li>
<li>The second chart shows Top 20 Nodes with the highest event counts over the past week.</li>
<li>The third chart shows Top 20 Nodes with the highest event counts over the past month.</li>
<li>The fourth chart shows Top 20 Nodes with the highest event counts over the past year.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Step 3- Launch 3-EventHotSpots-AlertGroup</strong>This event analysis app includes analysing events originating by the type of monitoring agent, situation, or similar classification commonly captured in the AlertGroup field. 
<ul>
<li>The first chart shows Top 20 AlertGroups with the highest event counts over the past day.</li>
<li>The second chart shows Top 20 AlertGroups with the highest event counts over the past week.</li>
<li>The third chart shows Top 20 AlertGroups with the highest event counts over the past month.</li>
<li>The fourth chart shows Top 20 AlertGroups with the highest event counts over the past year.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Step 4- Launch 4-EventHotSpots-AlertKey</strong>This event analysis app includes analysing events originating by the type of monitoring agent, situation, or similar classification commonly captured in the AlertKey field. 
<ul>
<li>The first chart shows Top 20 AlertKeys with the highest event counts over the past day.</li>
<li>The second chart shows Top 20 AlertKeys with the highest event counts over the past week.</li>
<li>The third chart shows Top 20 AlertKeys with the highest event counts over the past month.</li>
<li>The fourth chart shows Top 20 AlertKeys with the highest event counts over the past year.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Step 5- Launch 5-EventHotSports-NodeSeverity</strong> Another common event analysis task includes analysing nodes with the most events by event severity. 
<ul>
<li>The first chart shows Top 20 Nodes with the highest event counts by event severity over the past hour.</li>
<li>The second chart shows Top 20 Nodes with the highest event counts by event severity over the past day.</li>
<li>The third chart shows Top 20 Nodes with the highest event counts by event severity over the past week.</li>
<li>The fourth chart shows Top 20 Nodes with the highest event counts by event severity over the past month.</li>
<li>The fifth chart shows Top 20 Nodes with the highest event counts by event severity over the past year.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Step 6- Launch 6-EventHotSports-NodeAlertGroup</strong> This event analysis app includes analysing the Top 20 nodes with events by the type of monitoring agent, situation, or similar classification commonly captured in the AlertGroup field.
<ul>
<li>The first chart shows Top 20 Nodes with the highest event counts from the Top 10 AlertGroups over the past hour.</li>
<li>The second chart shows Top 20 Nodes with the highest event counts from the Top 10 AlertGroups over the past day.</li>
<li>The third chart shows Top 20 Nodes with the highest event counts from the Top 10 AlertGroups over the past week.</li>
<li>The fourth chart shows Top 20 Nodes with the highest event counts from the Top 10 AlertGroups over the past month.</li>
<li>The fifth chart shows Top 20 Nodes with the highest event counts from the Top 10 AlertGroups over the past year.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Step 7- Launch 7-EventHotSports-NodeAlertKey</strong> This event analysis app includes analysing the Top 20 nodes with events by the type of monitoring agent, situation, or similar classification commonly captured in the AlertKey field.
<ul>
<li>The first chart shows Top 20 Nodes with the highest event counts from the Top 10 AlertKeys over the past hour.</li>
<li>The second chart shows Top 20 Nodes with the highest event counts from the Top 10 AlertKeys over the past day.</li>
<li>The third chart shows Top 20 Nodes with the highest event counts from the Top 10 AlertKeys over the past week.</li>
<li>The fourth chart shows Top 20 Nodes with the highest event counts from the Top 10 AlertKeys over the past month.</li>
<li>The fifth chart shows Top 20 Nodes with the highest event counts from the Top 10 AlertKeys over the past year.</li>
</ul>
